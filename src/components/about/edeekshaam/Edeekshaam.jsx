            E-Deekshaam is an adaptable, assistive learning framework that can
            be used in both online and blended modes in two parts: the web-based
            system and a mobile application to accompany it. The framework would
            include content for children aged 6 to 18. The system will help
            teachers and parents by generating personalized individualized
            Education Programs which the teachers can later modify to suit the
            child&apos;s needs. Topics in domains ranging from motor training to
            social community interactions will be prepared in all possible
            formats and uploaded to the system. Authorized schools and special
            educators can access the content free of cost. In all, it will be a
            platform wherein the students&apos; performance, behaviors, and
            progress can be tracked, and a holistic learning environment is
            provided.
